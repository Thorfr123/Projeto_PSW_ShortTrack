# ShortTrack
ShortTrack is a simple to-do list platform that provides you a place where you can store and manage all your tasks. You can work on your daily tasks, or in those you really can't forget, and create as many lists as you wish to organize your work, trips, shopping, etc. Furthermore, you can have groups, where you can add all your team workers, and assign tasks to them.

In each list/group you can have as many tasks as you want, and you can set due dates and add more info to each task so you, or your workers, know exactly what to do.

Additionally, when you are in a hurry and can't finish the task your boss asked you to do, you can ask for the help of a colleague with some free time.

## Prerequirenments

If you want to use our application online you need to be connected to the FEUPNET. If you are directly connected the FEUP network and you will only use our application there, you don't have to install anything else and you can use all the features of our application. Otherwise, you need to connect to the FEUPNET through a VPN service.

You can use the program without being connected to FEUP, but only the offline features are available.

## Instalation

To install the program, follow the instruction in [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Thorfr123/Projeto_PSW_ShortTrack/blob/master/SCRUM_Files/Installation_Instructions/Installation.md).
