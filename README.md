# ShortTrack
This is the project developed during the first semester of the 1st year of the Electrical Engineering MSc, for the Software Design course unit.

ShortTrack is a simple to-do list platform that provides you a place where you can store and manage all your tasks

## Installation

See the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Thorfr123/Projeto_PSW_ShortTrack/blob/master/installation.md) in the repository.

## Prerequisites

To use all the functionalities of the application, it is necessary to have a connection to the FEUP network, as the application uses a database located on that network.
If you don't have access to that network, the app can still be used, but only offline features are available.

## Utilization

See [User Manual](https://github.com/Thorfr123/Projeto_PSW_ShortTrack/files/10573314/PSW_User_Manual.pdf) for further details.
